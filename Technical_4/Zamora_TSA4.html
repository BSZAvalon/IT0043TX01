        <h1>Advisory</h1>
        <h2 >On january 4 and 5, 2024</h2>
        <p>
            We hope this message finds you well. Due to the extraordinary heatwave currently affecting our region,
                    we have made the decision to cancel all classes for<span style="color: green"> january 4 and 5.</span>
                    The safety and well-being of our community are our utmost priority, 
                    and with temperatures soaring to unprecedented levels, we believe it is in everyone's 
                    best interest to stay indoors and avoid unnecessary exposure to the heat.
        </p>

        <p>
            Thank you for your understanding and cooperation during this time. Stay safe,
                     and we look forward to resuming normal operations soon.
        </p>
        
        <p> 
            Keep Safe, Tamaraw
